# Chapter 5 - USBX Host Classes API

This chapter covers all the exposed APIs of the USBX host classes. The
following APIs for each class are described in detail.

- HID class
- CDC-ACM class
- CDC-ECM class
- Storage class

## ux_host_class_hid_client_register

Register a HID client to the HID class.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_hid_client_register(
    UCHAR *hid_client_name,
    UINT (*hid_client_handler)
    (struct UX_HOST_CLASS_HID_CLIENT_COMMAND_STRUCT *));
```

### Description

This function is used to register a HID client to the HID class and returns immediately. The HID class needs to find a match between a HID device and HID client before requesting data from this device.

> **Note:** The C string of hid_client_name must be NULL-terminated and the length of it (without the NULL-terminator itself) must be no larger than **UX_HOST_CLASS_HID_MAX_CLIENT_NAME_LENGTH**.

### Parameters

- **hid_client_name** Pointer to the HID client name.
- **hid_client_handler** Pointer to the HID client handler.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) The data transfer was completed
- **UX_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT** (0x12) Memory allocation for client failed.
- **UX_MEMORY_ARRAY_FULL** (0x1a) Max clients already registered.
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_ALREADY_INSTALLED** (0x58) This class already exists

### Example

```c
UINT status;

/* The following example illustrates how to register a HID client, in
this case a USB mouse, to the HID class. */

status = ux_host_class_hid_client_register("ux_host_class_hid_client_mouse",
    ux_host_class_hid_mouse_entry);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */
```

## ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_register

Register a callback from the HID class.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_register(
    UX_HOST_CLASS_HID *hid,
    UX_HOST_CLASS_HID_REPORT_CALLBACK *call_back);
```

### Description

This function is used to register a callback from the HID class to the HID client when a report is received and returns immediately.

### Parameters

- **hid** Pointer to the HID class instance
- **call_back** Pointer to the call_back structure

### Return values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) The data transfer was completed
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_INSTANCE_UNKNOWN** (0x5b) Invalid HID instance.
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_HID_REPORT_ERROR** (0x79) Error in the report callback registration.

### Example

```c
UINT status;

/* This example illustrates how to register a HID client, in this case a USB mouse, to the HID class. In this case, the HID client is asking the HID class to call the client for each usage received in the HID report. */

call_back.ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_id = 0;
call_back.ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_function = ux_host_class_hid_mouse_callback;

call_back.ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_buffer = UX_NULL;
call_back.ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_flags = UX_HOST_CLASS_HID_REPORT_INDIVIDUAL_USAGE;

call_back.ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_length = 0;

status = ux_host_class_hid_report_callback_register(hid, &call_back);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */
```

## ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_start

Start the periodic endpoint for a HID class instance.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_start(UX_HOST_CLASS_HID *hid);
```

### Description

This function is used to start the periodic (interrupt) endpoint for the instance of the HID class that is bound to this HID client. The HID class cannot start the periodic endpoint until the HID client is activated and therefore it is left to the HID client to start this endpoint to receive reports.

To protect states for reentry, it waits the semaphore of HID instance before modifying periodic report polling state.

### Input Parameter

- **hid** Pointer to the HID class instance.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Periodic reporting successfully started.
- **ux_host_class_hid_PERIODIC_REPORT_ERROR** (0x7A) Error in the periodic report.
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_INSTANCE_UNKNOWN** (0x5b) HID class instance does not exist.

### Example

```c
UINT status;

/* The following example illustrates how to start the periodic
endpoint. */

status = ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_start(hid);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */
```

## ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_stop

Stop the periodic endpoint for a HID class instance.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_stop(UX_HOST_CLASS_HID *hid);
```

### Description

This function is used to stop the periodic (interrupt) endpoint for the instance of the HID class that is bound to this HID client. The HID class cannot stop the periodic endpoint until the HID client is deactivated, all its resources freed and therefore it is left to the HID client to stop this endpoint.

To protect states for reentry, it waits the semaphore of HID instance before modifying periodic report polling state.

### Input Parameter

- **hid** Pointer to the HID class instance.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Periodic reporting successfully stopped.
- **ux_host_class_hid_PERIODIC_REPORT_ERROR** (0x7A) Error in the periodic report.
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_INSTANCE_UNKNOWN** (0x5b) HID class instance does not exist

### Example

```c
UINT status;

/* The following example illustrates how to stop the periodic endpoint. */

status = ux_host_class_hid_periodic_report_stop(hid);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */
```

                                USHORT *idle_time, USHORT report_id)
```

### Description

This function is used to get idle rate time period used by device to keep sending reports when there is no data.

- **UX_TRANSFER_STALLED** (0x21) Request is not accepted by device, there is no idle rate control and reports are only sent when there is data.

### Example

```c
USHORT idle_time;
UINT   status;

/* The following example illustrates how to get idle rate. */

status = ux_host_class_hid_idle_get(hid, &idle_time, 0);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */

    decodes them for application usage. The decoding is performed
    based on a set of arrays that act as maps – which array is used
    depends on the raw key value (i.e. keypad and non-keypad) and
    the current state of the keyboard (i.e. shift, caps lock, etc.). */

    LONG *usage, 
    ULONG *value);
```

### Description

This function is used to get the remote control usages.

### ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read

Read from the cdc_acm interface.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read(
    UX_HOST_CLASS_CDC_ACM *cdc_acm,
    UCHAR *data_pointer,
    ULONG requested_length,
    ULONG *actual_length);
```

### Description

This function reads from the cdc_acm interface. The call is blocking and only returns when there is either an error or when the transfer is complete.

> **Note:** This functions reads raw bulk data from device, so it keeps pending until buffer is full or device terminates the transfer by a short packet (including Zero Length Packet). For more details, please refer to [**General Considerations for Bulk Transfer**](usbx-device-stack-5.md#general-considerations-for-bulk-transfer).
> The function reads bytes from the device packet by packet. If the prepared buffer size is smaller than a packet and the device sends more data than expected (in other words, the prepared buffer size is not a multiple of the USB endpoint's max packet size), then buffer overflow will occur. To avoid this issue, the recommended way to read is to allocate a buffer exactly one packet size (USB endpoint max packet size). This way if there is more data, the next read can get it and no buffer overflow will occur. If there is less data, the current read can get a short packet instead of generating an error.

### Parameters

- **cdc_acm** Pointer to the cdc_acm class instance.
- **data_pointer** Pointer to the buffer address of the data payload.
- **requested_length** Length to be received.
- **actual_length** Length actually received.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) The data transfer was completed.
- **UX_HOST_CLASS_INSTANCE_UNKNOWN** (0x5b) The cdc_acm instance is invalid.
- **UX_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT** (0x5c) Transfer timeout, reading incomplete.
- **UX_TRANSFER_BUFFER_OVERFLOW** (0x27) Transfer buffer overflow, inside a USB packet, host sending more bytes than available buffer.

### Example

```c
UINT status;

/* The following example illustrates this service. */

status = ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read(cdc_acm, data_pointer,
    requested_length, &actual_length);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */

## ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_start

Begins background reception of data from the device.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_start(
    UX_HOST_CLASS_CDC_ACM *cdc_acm,
    UX_HOST_CLASS_CDC_ACM_RECEPTION *cdc_acm_reception);
```

### Description

This function causes USBX to continuously read data from the device in the background. Upon completion of each transaction, the callback specified in **cdc_acm_reception** is invoked so the application may perform further processing of the transaction's data.

> **Note:** **ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read** must not be used while background reception is in use.

> **Note:** **cdc_acm_reception** must have its callback function assigned, where *ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_tail* must be moved after data processed. The example of this callback implement follows:
> ```c
> void demo_host_cdc_acm_reception_callback(UX_HOST_CLASS_CDC_ACM *cdc_acm, UINT status, UCHAR *reception_buffer, ULONG reception_size)
> {
> UX_HOST_CLASS_CDC_ACM_RECEPTION *reception = cdc_acm -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception;
> 
>   /* Perform processing of the transaction's data at reception_buffer.  */
> 
>   /* Move reception data tail to next buffer.  */
>   if (reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_tail + reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_block_size >= reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_buffer + reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_buffer_size)
> 
>       /* We are at the end of the buffer. Move back to the beginning.  */
>       reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_tail = reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_buffer;
>   else
> 
>       /* Program the tail to be after the current buffer.  */
>       reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_data_tail += reception -> ux_host_class_cdc_acm_reception_block_size;
> }
> ```
