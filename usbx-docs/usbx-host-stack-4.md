    return(UX_SUCCESS);

/* A printer normally has one configuration, retrieve 1st configuration only. */

### Parameters

- *transfer request*: Pointer to the transfer request to be aborted.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) The USB transfer for this transfer request was
canceled.

### Example

## ux_host_stack_transfer_request

Request a USB transfer.

### Prototype

```c
UINT ux_host_stack_transfer_request(UX_TRANSFER REQUEST *transfer request);
```

### Description

This function performs a USB transaction. On entry the transfer request gives the endpoint pipe selected for this transaction and the parameters associated with the transfer (data payload, length of transaction). For Control pipe, the transaction is blocking and will only return when the three phases of the control transfer have been completed or if there is a previous error. For other pipes, the USB stack will schedule the transaction on the USB but will not wait for its completion. Each transfer request for non-blocking pipes has to specify a completion routine handler.

When the function call returns, the status of the transfer request should be examined as it contains the result of the transaction.

### Input Parameter

- *transfer_request*: Pointer to the transfer request. The transfer request contains all the necessary information required for the transfer.

### Return Values

- **UX_SUCCESS** (0x00) The USB transfer for this transfer request was scheduled properly. The status code of the transfer request should be examined when the transfer request completes.
- **UX_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT** (0x12) Not enough memory to allocate the necessary controller resources.
- **UX_TRANSFER_NOT_READY** (0x25) The device was in an invalid state – must be ATTACHED,ADDRESSED, or CONFIGURED.

### Example:

```c
UINT status;

/* Create a transfer request for the SET_CONFIGURATION request. No data for this request. */
transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_requested_length = 0;
transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_function = UX_SET_CONFIGURATION;
transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_type =
    | UX_REQUEST_OUT           |
    | UX_REQUEST_TYPE_STANDARD |
    UX_REQUEST_TARGET_DEVICE;

transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_value = (USHORT)
    configuration -> ux_configuration_descriptor.bConfigurationValue;
transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_index = 0;

/* Send request to HCD layer. */
status = ux_host_stack_transfer_request(transfer_request);

/* If status equals UX_SUCCESS, the operation was successful. */
```
