# Chapter 1 - Introduction to USBX Host Stack

USBX is a full-featured USB stack for deeply embedded applications. This chapter introduces USBX, describing its applications and benefits.

## USBX features

USBX support the three existing USB specifications: 1.1, 2.0 and OTG. It is designed to be scalable and will accommodate simple USB topologies with only one connected device as well as complex topologies with multiple devices and cascading hubs. USBX supports all the data transfer types of the USB protocols: control, bulk, interrupt, and isochronous.

USBX supports both the host side and the device side. Each side is
comprised of three layers.

- Controller layer
- Stack layer
- Class layer

The relationship between the USB layers is as follows.

## Powerful Services of USBX

### Multiple Host Controller Support

USBX can support multiple USB host controllers running concurrently. This feature allows USBX to support the USB 2.0 standard using the backward compatibility scheme associated with most USB 2.0 host controllers on the market today.

### USB Software Scheduler

USBX contains a USB software scheduler necessary to support USB controllers that do not have hardware list processing. The USBX software scheduler will organize USB transfers with the correct frequency of service and priority, and will instruct the USB controller to execute each transfer.

### Complete USB Device Framework Support

USBX can support the most demanding USB devices, including multiple configurations, multiple interfaces, and multiple alternate settings.

### Easy-To-Use APIs

USBX provides the very best deeply embedded USB stack in a manner that is easy to understand and use. The USBX API makes the services intuitive and consistent. By using the provided USBX class APIs, the user application does not need to understand the complexity of the USB protocols.
